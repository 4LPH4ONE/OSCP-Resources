## Tips for Effective Note-Taking

- **Use Markdown**: Markdown allows for easy formatting, code blocks, and linking in your notes.  
- **Create Templates**: Prepare templates for scanning results, enumeration steps, or exploitation commands to streamline the process.  
- **Group by Categories**: Organize your notes by categories like Enumeration, Privilege Escalation, and Web Exploitation for easy access.  
- **Keep It Concise**: Don't write unnecessary information; focus on the most effective commands, exploits, and techniques.  
- **Use Diagrams**: Visual representations (network diagrams, attack trees) help in organizing complex processes.
