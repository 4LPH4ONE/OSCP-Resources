### PWK Labs Overview

The **Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK)** course, offered by Offensive Security, provides a comprehensive learning path for aspiring penetration testers. The labs are an essential part of the PWK course, offering hands-on experience with real-world scenarios. Below is an overview of the PWK labs:

- **Lab Structure**: The labs are designed to mimic real-world environments with a variety of challenges. These challenges include both active exploitation and post-exploitation tasks, ranging from web application attacks to network-based penetration testing and privilege escalation.
  
- **Environment Setup**: The labs provide a controlled environment, where students can interact with vulnerable machines hosted on a private network. This is done in a virtual environment, with each student having their own isolated lab space.

- **Lab Activities**:
  - **Scanning & Enumeration**: Students are tasked with scanning the target network and identifying active services, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities.
  - **Exploitation**: The core of the PWK labs revolves around exploitation techniques, including SQL injection, buffer overflow, and privilege escalation.
  - **Post-Exploitation**: After successfully exploiting a vulnerability, students move into post-exploitation, where they gather sensitive data, maintain persistence, and prepare for further exploitation.

- **Progression**: The labs are designed to scale in complexity. Starting with easier machines, students progress through increasingly difficult targets, which helps build foundational skills and advanced techniques.

- **Report Submission**: As part of the final assessment for the PWK course, students are required to submit a report documenting their exploitation and post-exploitation process for each machine. This reinforces professional documentation skills and helps students refine their methodology.
